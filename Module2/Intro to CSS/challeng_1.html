        <p>The <em>Cat</em> is awesome because <strong>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. </strong>.</p>
